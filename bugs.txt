Bug #1: the user cannot see the original inventory.
Description: When starting the program, I made it possible for the user to see the initial inventory of the dealership, but due to the fast loading of the simulation, the initial output lines disappear.
Fix:  Add the menu where there is an option to view the initial inventory before the simulation.
