UNIT TESTING FOR LAB 30 

To verify that the logic my simulation is correct, I created a simple unit test for the `simulation()` function. This function handles monthly dealership operations including adding cars, selling them, processing trade-ins, and calculating profit.

The unit test:
1.Creates a controlled Car_Array object.
2.Uses fixed vectors of Car objects for sale and trade-in.
3.Calls simulation() once.
4.Prints the updated inventory and profit to verify expected behavior.
